BABY NAMER

reddit-style baby name voter.

TODO:
* security wot?
* js: update votes and resort name list ajax-ily
      - may be fine to just reload the page if need to resort, since
        nearly entire page is being redrawn in case of resort.
      - though there are cool js or flashy things that could be done with
        resort too...
* auth: make people give a name to vote, add suggestions
* votes: enforce one vote per person
